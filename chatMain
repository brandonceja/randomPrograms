/*
  This code is meant to create a "chat" between the java virtual machine (server) and
  a terminal using Telnet(client) all of this through socket programming.
  
  Here we only instantiate an object of the class connector and we call on it
  the method start();
  You can check the class connector in:  randomPrograms/conector
  
  In order to use the chat just use the next command in your terminal:
  
  telnet 127.0.0.1 9000

  which means "use telnet to connect to my local IP adress on the port 9000"
  
  Then you can type any message and it will be shown in the JVM console, or you can
  type in the JVM console and it will be shown in the terminal. The connection stops if
  one of the users types "stop".

  It's a very basic chat, you can only send one message at a time and it is not
  well structured, I hope to make a better version in the future, but I wanted to
  share it now with the world, hopping it helps someone with its own projects.
  
  For any doubts or suggestions you can contact me at: darth1701@hotmail.com
